                <h3>Why Should We Care About Plastic Waste?</h3>
                <p>Plastic pollution is a growing environmental concern that poses serious threats to ecosystems,
                    wildlife, and human health. The widespread use of single-use plastics and improper disposal
                    practices have led to the accumulation of plastic waste in oceans, rivers, and landfills, causing
                    harm to marine life and polluting our environment.</p>
                <h3>Consequences of Plastic Usage</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Plastic pollution threatens marine life, with millions of animals dying each year due to
                        ingestion or entanglement in plastic debris.</li>
                    <li>Plastic waste disrupts ecosystems and habitats, affecting biodiversity and ecosystem balance.
                    </li>
                    <li>Microplastics, tiny plastic particles, contaminate water sources and enter the food chain,
                        posing risks to human health.</li>
                </ul>
