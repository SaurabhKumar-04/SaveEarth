        <h1>Different Stages in Plastic Production</h1>

        <div class="section">
            <h2 class="section-title">1. Raw Material Extraction</h2>
            <p>Plastic is made from natural resources like oil or natural gas, which are extracted from deep underground
                or collected from wells. This process involves drilling, pumping, and refining to obtain the raw
                materials needed for plastic production.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2 class="section-title">2. Polymerization</h2>
            <p>Raw materials undergo a process called polymerization, where they are transformed into long chains of
                molecules called polymers. This process typically occurs in large reactors under controlled conditions,
                where monomers are chemically bonded to form polymer chains.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2 class="section-title">3. Compounding and Processing</h2>
            <p>Additives are mixed with polymers to enhance properties like strength or flexibility. Then, the plastic
                is shaped using machines into various forms. Compounding involves blending polymers with additives such
                as colorants, stabilizers, and fillers to achieve desired characteristics.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2 class="section-title">4. Manufacturing of Products</h2>
            <p>Using specialized tools and machines, plastic is molded into different products such as bottles, toys, or
                car parts. This stage involves processes like injection molding, extrusion, blow molding, and
                thermoforming to shape plastic into final products.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2 class="section-title">5. Quality Control and Testing</h2>
            <p>Finished products are thoroughly checked for defects or inconsistencies to ensure they meet quality
                standards. Quality control measures include visual inspection, dimensional checks, mechanical testing,
                and other tests to verify product performance and durability.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2 class="section-title">6. Packaging and Distribution</h2>
            <p>Plastic products are packaged and sent to stores or consumers. Packaging plays a role in protecting
                products but should be minimized to reduce waste. Sustainable packaging solutions, such as recyclable
                materials or minimal packaging, can help minimize environmental impact.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2 class="section-title">7. End of Life Considerations</h2>
            <p>Companies are designing products to be recyclable and using more recycled materials. Recycling helps
                reduce waste and conserve resources. Additionally, initiatives such as extended producer responsibility
                (EPR) encourage manufacturers to take responsibility for their products' environmental impact throughout
                their lifecycle.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2 class="section-title">Conclusion</h2>
            <p>The production stage of plastic waste tracking involves a series of complex processes, from raw material
                extraction to end-of-life considerations. By understanding and addressing each stage's environmental
                impact, we can work towards a more sustainable and circular economy, where plastic products are
                produced, used, and disposed of responsibly.</p>
